299 / 329	expand matter

need to expand a variable and parse it only if
	there is only one word  (=                  bonjour$USER                  )
	no quote (= " || ' )


check EXIT builtin



CASES:
124 - it's impossible to have an env var startung with a number. 
And basically, bash processes $9 as 10th arguement in the line. As in the line "echo $9HOME"
 there is only 2 args, it prints HOME because $9 = NULL and HOME as HOME
In our minishell, we doesn't process $ with numbers. So I added in handler only logic to handle
 env var starting with letter or _ symbol and handler for $? pair. For the rest cases, symbol 
 after $ is considered as just a letter - it means that my handler prints it as ordinary word

126 - I dunno what result you got, but I don't have UID env var and, therefore, NULL is returned
 for the first env var. For HOME, it returns value and echo prints only the second thing

220 - it makes our minishell to turn into zombi mode (sleeping) and it works

219 - 

299 / 329 - Dont have to handle it since its an Internal field Separtor utils that handle it on bash
		and it is not written in the subject as something we have to do
